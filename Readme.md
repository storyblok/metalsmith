# Storyblok Metalsmith Demo

The idea of Metalsmith is quite simple: “An extremely simple, pluggable static site generator”. So in this quick walkthrough, we will have a look at how we can use the data from the Storyblok API with a Metalsmith project to create some pages. At the end of this article, you will have a Metalsmith project which renders components filled with data from the Storyblok API.

## How to run

You can try it yourself by simply doing the following:

```
npm install

npm run dev // starts a local express dev environment (port: 4000) and triggers the build
```

Visit: [http://localhost:4000/home](http://localhost:4000/home) to get your initial page.
